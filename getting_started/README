The Makefile should do almost all work for you. If you want to use a
different version of LyX either change your path, or define the LYX
env var like so:

LYX=/home/software/lyx-1.6/bin/lyx make

When the Makefile generates html it will complain about undefined
control sequences. Just keep hitting "r" and "enter" until it's
done. I haven't had time to figure out how to fix this.
